Things To DO:

- Add bash auto completion
  - Basic implementation done, need to add to install script
- Security and code scanning tools

- (Done) `-a|--all` now searches everything by disabling default excludes while still honoring any explicit `--exclude` values.

- Add functionality to build the project into a .rpm, .deb, .apk (for alpine linux), and Arch Linux package.  Look at possible approaches to this and present me with some implementation options/recommendations.

- Create a Brew package for Mac.  It should also be compatible with Brew for Linux.
