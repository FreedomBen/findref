Things To DO:

- Add bash auto completion
  - Basic implementation done, need to add to install script
- Security and code scanning tools

- Add functionality to build the project into a .rpm, .deb, .apk (for alpine linux), and Arch Linux package.  Look at possible approaches to this and present me with some implementation options/recommendations.

- Create a Brew package for Mac.  It should also be compatible with Brew for Linux.

- Write a man page for findref and include it in the packages

- Update README.md.erb and ARCHIVES.md.erb to include the new linux packages (rpm, deb, apk, arch linux)

- Are the shell completion files getting packages into the rpm, deb, apk, etc?

- Add packages for all platform targets supported by nfpm
